##Node.js Express Server with MongoDB and Mongoose
This is a simple Node.js Express server with a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose schemas. The server is built using the layer method connections, dl (model, controller), bl (services), router + main router index js with an intermediate layer to verify the patch.

#Getting Started
To run the server, you must first install NPM and run npm install in the terminal to install the necessary packages:

...bash
npm install mongoose express dotenv jsonwebtoken cors

Then, create an .env file in the root directory with the following variables:
PORT=3000
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb
Make sure to replace mydb with the name of your MongoDB database.

#Usage
To start the server, run the following command:
...bash
npm start

The server will start on the specified port (default is 3000).

#Layers
Connection Layer
The connection layer is responsible for setting up the connection to MongoDB using Mongoose.

DL (Data Layer)
The data layer consists of the model and controller, which define the structure of the data and how it is accessed.

BL (Business Layer)
The business layer consists of services that perform business logic on the data.

Router Layer
The router layer defines the endpoints and routes for the server.

Middleware Layer
The middleware layer includes an intermediate layer to verify the patch.
